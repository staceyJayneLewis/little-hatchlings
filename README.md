# LITTLE HATCHLINGS

<!-- overview of project -->
Little Hatchlings is a childcare nursery that is looking to stand out against other competitors and to develop more centers around Wales, and so, the business owners are looking to invest in a website that will give the best representation of the nursery and what they can expect. The nursery's aim is to encourage parents to book a viewing of the nursery to increase the nursery applications and grow the business. Many nurseries like Little Hatchlings do not have a website at all or depend on social media pages such as Facebook and Twitter to hold any contact information and updates of the nursery. After I conducted my own research online and creating my own survey on surveyMonkey (https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/WXV275K), it is apparent that, since we are becoming a more digital dominated world, that most parents use online/mobile as their first method of searching for a nursery. Using my online research but also speaking to the nursery owner directly, it is also clear that the nursery's target audience is around 18 - 40 and in this age range, the audience is likely to be tech-savvy and so, a website is the perfect way to give that first impression to the target audience. The website is responsive and so it can be accessed on most devices, such as mobiles, tablets and laptops/ computers, making it user friendly for most computers.

## UX

The Strategy - We can use the power of the website to persuade our audience that this is the nursery that they want to put their child/children in and having a website makes it easy to share and advertise on social media, business cards and by word of mouth. The needs and wants of the target audience are reassurance that they are putting their child in a nursery where they are safe, comfortable with the staff and are properly taken care of in the absence of the parents(food, water, nappy, changes etc). Another need that the user wants to know is that their child will develop their social skills, confidence and learning skills to a high standard whilst at the nursery in preparation for mainstream schooling. To help achieve a successful website, I have listened to the parents' most common responses in the survey I conducted and used that information to decide on the hierarchy/order of the website, such as to provide reassurance by displaying awards they've had, reviews/customer feedback, ofsted rating, Google ratings, day nurseries rating awards.

Scope - I have noticed other nursery sites laying out their pages in the generic way and what the nursery THINK's is priority information the parents want to see instead of what the parents REALLY want to see, so designing the website based on customer's response/feedback is just one of the things we can offer that makes our website stand out to other websites. 
When conducting research on external sources, the 'capture education website'(https://capture-education.co.uk/blog/2018/04/25/5-ways-a-nursery-website-can-benefit-you/â€‹), recommends good quality images, a 'meet the staff page', testimonials and a map on the contact page of the location/s are the 4 important features for nursery websites. Nurseries say they just need a website with contact information, but as mentioned above, what they actually need is a website to make an impression, boost their reputation and do all the talking for the nursery through gallery images, design and information. The below importance and feasibility chart is created by me based on the surveyMonkey responses, external resource research and what the nursery say they want, which resulted in the outcome in the screenshot below.

![screenshot](documentation/features-importance.png)

When looking at the chart, one of the important features is a, meet the staff page which shows images of all the staff however it could be a future feature as there are more important features needed such as showing the facilities and gallery to increase customer interaction and reputation.

Structure - For the structure and positioning of the navigation bar, I used a nested list and, decided to stick with the usual conventions of what users expect. There is no need to make the product complex as it won't retain the users' attention. With this in mind, I have used a hierarchical structure for the website layout as it helps prioritize the design elements in order of importance and shows the key message and role of the particular pages.The hierarchical structure gives a good balance of it not being linear or complex as these structure layouts could be a disadvantage for nurseries' needs, such as forcing the user to follow the order of how they view the site or overload of information. 
I have also made sure that the users need as little scrolling or clicks as possible to get to their destination by having a navigation bar fixed at the top and buttons on each section for a user-friendly, easy experience. Also, to stick to the conventions expected by users, I have used a hover selector as an interactive element on any call for action buttons to demonstrate that they are buttons. 

Skeleton Plane - Creating the wireframes allowed me to determine what links and content would be useful to make the website user-friendly alongside prioritizing the content needed to achieve business goals. As I previously mentioned, I will use the survey feedback and my independent research to prioritize the layout of the website so that in the wireframes I can see visually how they will be organized, such as the testimonials to the top of the page just under the callout heading, then about the nursery and the awards and achievements that the nursery have achieved.
I can see how each screen relates to each other and how the information will be laid out across all devices, which helps me see the style adjustments needed depending on different screen sizes. An example of this is how the text works better center aligned on mobile layouts rather than aligned to the left like on larger scale screens. This decision made it simple to carry out the style throughout the design for text and buttons to keep a smooth and easy user experience.
The wireframes also allowed me to visually see how the layout will particularly work on laptops/computers as the mobile and iPad layouts are the same however the layout style would not work for larger devices as there would be too much space or the content would be too large. The mobile and iPad layouts are simple one-column layouts across all pages and therefore I can see that large devices would work better in 2 columns for example the gallery can be split into 2 sections on a large screen so the user can see all the options of images available. This is where I also decided I could use the Lightbox tool to allow users to select an image to view it bigger if needed. Originally, I tried the smaller device gallery layouts as one column but the reason I had the gallery as 2 columns is so that the user can see the range of images rather than having one column and scroll through the many images one by one, and even though the images are smaller in 2 columns, the Lightbox tool allows users to view the images full screen when selected.
The navigation and footer will be the same across all devices however the wireframe allowed me to see that on smaller devices I would need to collapse the navigation bar as the text will not fit horizontally on small devices and that I would need to center the text on the dropdown to make sure it corresponds with structure of the design. I can also see where I would need to include any links and buttons that will improve user interaction and experience, which allows me to move on and discuss how I can make it clear visually with design. 


Surface Plane - With this in mind, it reminded me that I also need to think about how the drop down will be styled and

After seeing the information organsied in the wireframes it gives me ideas on what styles or effect can be used to improve user interactivity such having a carousel to display the testimonials so customers can click throught them at the pace they wish or scroll past them if they are not interested. 

 sensory - tyopgraphy - font - images - transitions - order and sequence - layout - visable - videos.
As mentioned previously, the website needs to be friendly as the website will be the first thing they see when looking for childcare for they children and so the design needs to be appealing and stand out.  I have added a small amount of visual metaphors on the gallery and contact page headers as they are everyday icons users are likely to be familiar with that I can incorporate into the design.

### Colour Scheme

For colour scheme I decided that as the target audience are the parents of the children that the 3 colours white, purple and yellow would be enough to look professional and playful but it also doesn't distract the users with too much colour.  My logo little hatchlings has a chick icon in the logo to represent the 'hatchlings' in the brand name and the stereotypical colour for a chick in design is yellow but also yellow can symbolize the unisex and the 'happy' element of the nursery.

The yellow has been used to highlight the important interactive buttons across the website and mobile devices such as form buttons, search buttons and quick access buttons but also to attract user attention to important headings. Yellow has also been incorperated in the callout section design as it has highlighted the important wording with an yellow underline in the heading for the visual communication. 
The purple (#5A31AD) has been used in the illustration hero image to symbolize the child 'out in space' and so I have also carried that colour through the website to keep the color scheme and theme consistent through the website. The purple has also been useful for the design background colours and interactive elements such as links on navbar and gallery.
I have used both yellow and purple colours throughout the device designs so that the page designs flow nicely into each other and can be clearly identified as one.

The black (#000000) and white (#ffffff) have been used for the primary text and secondary text across the mobile, tablet and website devices alternating the colour of the primary/secondary text depending on the device size. 
	
- `#000000` used for primary/secondary text.
- `#ffffff` used for primary/secondary text.
- `#ffff00` used for primary highlights.
- `#5A31AD` used for highlights/background colours.

I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/ffffff-5a31ad-ffff00-000000) to generate my colour palette.

### Typography

- [Patrick Hand](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Patrick+Hand?query=patrick) was used from google fonts for the childlike primary headers and titles.
	
- [Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins?query=poppins) was used from google fonts for all other secondary text.
	
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used throughout the site, such as the social media icons in the footer.

## Features

### Existing Features

**Brand logo**
	
- When deciding a brand name for my nursery I decided little hatchlings would be very fitting as it symbolises that the children are young and growing together all in one place. I created the logo myself using a fun and childlike handrawn typeface to represent the playful, fun and creative aspect of our nursery.

![screenshot](documentation/feature03.png)

**Gallery & facilities page**
	
- I decided that creating a whole facilities page may not be feasible in the timescale that I have and so I incorperated the facilities in the gallery page by seperating the gallery into two sections. The reason behind this is because parents want to see the enviroment that their child will be in whilst at the nursery and the images of the rooms, outdoor area etc sets an idea of what it is like and may entice them to book a viewing at the nursery.

- You can see below in the screenshot a layout of the gallery in desktop version and in smaller devices. I have made the heading links for the smaller devices so when clicked it will jump scroll to the second section quickly so it is user friendly.
	
![screenshot](documentation/gallery-feature.png)

- I have also used the bootstrap lightbox feature to allow the images to be viewed in large scale as the images are in 2 columns rather than 1. I made the decision to use 2 columns on small devices to make it user friendly so if more images are added in future it is not exhaustive for the user as they can see more selection on their screen rather than scrolling each individual photo. An example of the lightbox feature is below:

### Future Features

**Check-in booking system**
- An idea could be a check in system for the children on the website or a dashboard where you can see updates throughout the day such as nappy changes, food menu, any medications taken etc to encourage customers to come back and interact with the website more. 

**Staff page displaying all the staff members**
- A page that has all the qualified staff members is important to have so the parents can see who will be looking after their children and putting faces to names can help parents build the relationship and trust with the staff. It can also reassure them to see the qualifications and experience that the staff members have.

**About Us Page**
- I would like to add an about page where I can go more in depth on the backrgound/history of the Nursery because I noticed that every response I had from my survey I conducted said they do like to read about the background of the nursery.

**Update/News section**
- Having a section with updates or recent changes on the nursery would be useful however it is not essential as reflecting on my surveyMonkey responses most customers would refer to our social media page for news/updates. 

**Language options**
- Giving the choice of languages to our users, particularly welsh language as the nursery is based in Wales. Ideally next to the contact us on the navigation bar or on the callout page you could have the choice to switch to welsh language.

<!-- future -->
If I had the time and resources what I would like to do after seeing the responses of my survey is to create a 'book a viewing' system for my website but also a system that allows you to sign your child into the nursery and sign them out.
 for example offering a booking system so you can book a viewing, displaying other parent reviews and showing any awards they have achieved. 
 showing the staff page
