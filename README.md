# LITTLE HATCHLINGS

<!-- overview of project -->
PROBLEM: Finding a childcare nursery can be a daunting experience for parents as they have the worry of leaving their precious bundle of joy in the care of trusted staff. There are many nurseries around but how do you know which nursery is best for your little one? Many nurseries do not have a website or have a Facebook website rather than investing in a website. 
SOLUTION: After I conducted a survey on survey monkey (post link) I can see most parents use online as their first way of searching for a nursery or contact information for a nursery and a website is the perfect way to give that first impression to your target audience. 

<!-- what the project hopes to accomplish, who it is intended to target, and how it will be useful to the target audience. -->
The nursery's target audience are parents and the project goal is to create a website so we can use the power of the website to persuade parents that this is the nursery that they want to put their child/children in. Provide the reassurance by displaying awards they've had, reviews/customer feedback, ofsted rating, google ratings, day nurseries rating awards.
I have noticed many other children nursery sites laying out their page depending on what they believe is the priority for them and the target audience, for example offering a booking system so you can book a viewing, displaying other parent reviews and showing any awards they have achieved. 
To decide my own hierarchy of the order in which I am going to do the layout of my website I conducted a survey to see what the opinions of other parents are regarding which they are looking for when deciding on a children's nursery that will help them make their decision and reassure them. 
If I had the time and resources what I would like to do after seeing the responses of my survey is to create a 'book a viewing' system for my website but also a system that allows you to sign your child into the nursery and sign them out.

<!-- What do they want? -->
Needs and wants of the target audience are reassurance that they are putting their child in a nursery where they are safe, comfortable with the staff/children and are properly taken care of in the absence of the parents(food, water, nappy, changes etc). Another need that the user wants is to see that they will develop their social skills, confidence and learning skills to a high standard whilst at the nursery before mainstream schooling. 
What functions do you perform? What is the day to day role? How is our offering different to other competitors?

capture education website recommends the 4 things that nurseries need on their website to make it succesful and they're priorities are good quality images, showing the staff, announcements/news/awards, map on the contact page of the location/s.

Scope - What nurseries say they need? What they actually need? What they don't know they need? Discuss the survey responses/ research. Could add survey monkey survey done as an extra information?

Structure Plane - I decided to stick to the conventions in the navigation bar as that is what users expect. There is no need to make the website complex as it won't keep the parents attention.. Simple and factful that demonstrates companies reputation and ratings.

Skeleton Plane - 

Surface Plane - The website needs to be friendly as the website will be the first thing they see when looking for childcare for they children.
