# LITTLE HATCHLINGS

<!-- overview of project -->
Little Hatchlings is a childcare nursery that is looking to stand out against other competitors and as they have developed more centers around Wales, the business owners are looking to invest in a website that will give the best representation of the nursery and what they can expect. The nursery's aim is to encourage parents to come and view the nursery to hopefully increase the nursery applications and grow the business. Many nurseries like Little Hatchlings do not have a website at all or depend on social media pages such as Facebook and Twitter to hold any contact information and updates of the nursery. After I conducted my own research online and creating my own survey on surveyMonkey (https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/WXV275K), it is apparent that, since we are becoming a more digital dominated world, that most parents use online/mobile as their first method of searching for a nursery. Using my online research but also speaking to the nursery owner directly, it is also clear that the nursery's target audience is around 18 - 40 and in this age range, the audience is likely to be tech-savvy and so, a website is the perfect way to give that first impression to the target audience. The website is responsive and so it can be accessed on most devices, such as mobiles, tablets and laptops/computers, making it user friendly.

## UX

The Strategy - We can use the power of the website to persuade our audience that this is the nursery that they want to put their child/children in and having a website makes it easy to share and advertise on social media, business cards and by word of mouth. The needs and wants of the target audience are reassurance that they are putting their child in a nursery where they are safe, comfortable with the staff and are properly taken care of in the absence of the parents(food, water, nappy, changes etc). What the parents also want to know is that their child will develop their social skills, confidence and learning skills to a high standard whilst at the nursery in preparation for mainstream schooling. To help achieve a successful website, I have listened to the parents' most common responses in the survey I conducted and used that information to decide on the hierarchy/order of the website, such as displaying any awards they've had, reviews/customer feedback, ofsted rating, Google ratings, day nurseries rating awards.

Scope - I have noticed other nursery sites laying out their pages in the generic way and what the nursery THINK is priority information the parents want to see instead of what the parents REALLY want to see, so designing the website based on customer's response/feedback is just one of the things we can offer that makes our website stand out to other websites. 
When conducting research on external sources, the 'capture education website'(https://capture-education.co.uk/blog/2018/04/25/5-ways-a-nursery-website-can-benefit-you/​), recommends good quality images, a 'meet the staff page', testimonials and a map on the contact page of the location as the 4 important features for nursery websites. Nurseries say they just need a website with contact information, but as mentioned above, what they actually need is a website to make an impression, boost their reputation and do all the talking for the nursery through gallery images, design and information. The below importance and feasibility chart is created by me based on the surveyMonkey responses, external resource research and what the nursery say they want, which resulted in the outcome in the screenshot below.

![screenshot](documentation/features-importance.png)

When looking at the chart, one of the important features is a, meet the staff page which shows images of all the staff however it could be a future feature as I have to work with the timeframe given and there are more important features needed such as showing the facilities and gallery to increase customer interaction and reputation.

Structure - For the structure and positioning of the navigation bar, I used a nested list and, decided to stick with the usual conventions of what users expect. There is no need to make the product complex as it won't retain the users' attention. With this in mind, I have used a hierarchical structure for the website layout as it helps prioritize the design elements in order of importance and shows the key message and role of the particular pages.The hierarchical structure gives a good balance of it not being linear or complex as these structure layouts could be a disadvantage for nurseries' needs, such as forcing the user to follow the order of how they view the site or overload of information. 
I have also made sure that the users need as little scrolling or clicks as possible to get to their destination by having a navigation bar fixed at the top and buttons on each section for a user-friendly, easy experience. Also, to stick to the conventions expected by users, I have used a hover selector as an interactive element on any call for action buttons to demonstrate that they are buttons. 

Skeleton Plane - Creating the wireframes allowed me to determine what links and content would be useful to make the website user-friendly alongside prioritizing the content needed to achieve business goals. As I previously mentioned, I will use the survey feedback and my independent research to prioritize the layout of the website so that in the wireframes I can see visually how they will be organized, such as the testimonials to the top of the page just under the callout heading, then about the nursery and the awards and achievements that the nursery have achieved.
I can see how each screen relates to each other and how the information will be laid out across all devices, which helps me see the style adjustments needed depending on different screen sizes. An example of this is how the text works better center aligned on mobile layouts rather than aligned to the left like on larger scale screens. This decision made it simple to carry out the style throughout the design for text and buttons to keep a smooth and easy user experience.
The wireframes also allowed me to visually see how the layout will particularly work on laptops/computers as the mobile and iPad layouts are the same however the layout style would not work for larger devices as there would be too much empty space or the content would be too large. The mobile and iPad layouts are simple one-column layouts across all pages and therefore I can see that large devices would work better in 2 columns for example the gallery can be split into 2 sections on a large screen so the user can see all the options of images available. This is where I also decided I could use the Lightbox tool(see link in tools and technologies) to allow users to select an image to view it bigger if needed. Originally, I tried the smaller device gallery layouts as one column but the reason I have the gallery as 2 columns is so that the user can see the range of images rather than having one column and scroll through the many images one by one, and even though the images are smaller in 2 columns, the Lightbox tool allows users to view the images full screen when selected. The gallery layout isn't just useful for the parents who use it but also for the business as no matter how many images they add to the gallery, the way the gallery is structured will not compromise the design layout. This is why I have gallery category headings as links so if there are numerous images to scroll through the user can use the links to jump to the 'Our hatchlings' section. 
The navigation and footer will be the same across all devices however the wireframe allowed me to see that on smaller devices I would need to collapse the navigation bar as the text will not fit horizontally on small devices and that I would need to center the text on the dropdown to make sure it corresponds with structure of the design. I can also see where I would need to include any links and buttons that will improve user interaction and experience, which allows me to move on and discuss how I can make it clear visually with design. 

Surface Plane - After seeing the information organised in the wireframes, it gives me ideas on what styles or effects can be used to improve visual communication, such as highlighting the buttons of the current active page so that the user always knows what page they are currently on. I decided to use a lighter shade of purple for the button and then the usual purple colour (#5A31AD) for the bold button text to highlight the active button across all devices to keep a consistent colour theme. With this in mind, for the drop down I have used the same styling but added a purple side border on the active button too to make it more prominant, and also added a shadow on the dropdown itself to demonstrate it is a dropdown element on top of the background.

To add a bit more user interaction, I have decided to use a carousel to display the testimonials as it will automatically scroll through them for the users or they can click through them at their own pace. I have added a small number of visual metaphors on the gallery and contact page headers, as they are everyday icons that users are likely to be familiar with that I can incorporate as part of the design. Also, the form and map is a good way of encouraging the users to interact with the site more as they can view which nursery branch is closest to them if needed and the form is readily available so the user doesn't have to be inconvenienced by going to their emails or twitter account just to contact us.

I have kept the choice of typography to just 2 different styles not be overpowering on the eye of the users and so they can easily identify that the certain fonts are used for the headings and then the other for the more detailed information. I have used the Google font 'Patrick Hands' for the primary headings of each page for a childlike fun typeface to add more personality to the page and emphasise the playfulness of the nursery. For the rest of the text on the site, I have used the Google font 'Poppins' throughout for a consistent style, and adjusted the weight on paragraph headings, or the active navbar button to stand out more to the user. Throughout the website, I have mainly used the default, 16px font size for most of the paragraph texts, however, the navigation bar text is slightly higher at 17px to stand out to the user as soon as they visit the page. The headings also have a higher font size due to their role of being the headings, and the larger scale devices have a text font-size of 20px to make the text on the larger screens readible.

For the images, I have designed my own hero image using a photo of my daughter in which I used photoshop and illustrator to help create the design. One of the main nursery objectives is to help develop the children's social skills, confidence and learning skills to a high standard in preparation for mainstream schooling, and to make that clear, I have written a powerful heading which says 'Watch their confidence grow as big as their imagination'. The heading inspired me to design the hero image, which is an illustration of an astronaut helmet drawn over an image of a child pretending to be flying out in space to portray how children play pretend using their imaginations, which have no limits to where they end, just like space. I have used a handrawn style underline to match the childlike design of the logo and font on the words in the heading that I want to draw attention to from the users. To keep the design theme flowing through the website, I used a similar background to the hero design in the gallery and contact headings to connect each page together visually. Rather than using a different colour for the design object of the hero image I just used the same purple colour as the background color but adjusted the opacity so the objects would be subltle in the background. All other images, such as the achievements (Google reviews, ofsted, food standards agency, NHS) and gallery images, are all stock images(see sources for links). The video was created using, vimeo by myself from using, stock video clips from stock video websites (See sources for links)so the users get a virtual tour of the nursery to get a feel of what to expect. 
For the layout I used a wavy design to break up the page section of the hero image with the testimonials section but also for content hinting so that the user knows to scroll down to reveal more information and again I have applied the wavy style on all other pages too.

Overall, throughout the design process I have kept in mind the hick's law (or the hick-hymen law) particularly when choosing the gallery layout as I have sectioned the gallery into 2 categories, images of the nursery and images of the children in their enviroment. By using the hick's law theory, it enables users to find items easily and obscures complexity by breaking up long or complex layouts into layouts that are visually pleasing. 


### Colour Scheme

For the colour scheme, I decided that as the target audience are the parents of the children, that the 3 colours, white, purple and yellow, would be enough to look professional and playful, but also doesn't distract the users with too much colour.  My logo little hatchlings has a chick icon in the logo to represent the 'hatchlings' in the brand name and the stereotypical colour for a chick is yellow, but also yellow can symbolize the unisex and the 'happy' element of the nursery.
The yellow has been used to highlight the important interactive buttons across the website such as form buttons, search buttons and quick access buttons but also to attract user attention to important headings. As previously mentioned, yellow has also been incorporated in the callout section design as it has highlighted the important wording with a yellow underline in the heading for visual communication. The purple (#5A31AD) has been used in the illustration hero image to symbolize the child 'out in space' and so I have also carried that colour through the website to keep the color scheme and theme consistent throughout. The purple has also been useful for the design background colours and interactive elements such as links on navbar and gallery. I have used both yellow and purple colours throughout the website so that the page designs flow nicely into each other and can be clearly identified as one.
Black (#000000) and white (#ffffff) have been used for the primary text and secondary text across the mobile, tablet and website devices alternating the colour of the primary/secondary text depending on the device size.
	
- `#000000` used for primary/secondary text.
- `#ffffff` used for primary/secondary text.
- `#ffff00` used for primary highlights.
- `#5A31AD` used for highlights/background colours.

I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/ffffff-5a31ad-ffff00-000000) to generate my colour palette.

![screenshot](documentation/coolors.png)


### Typography

- [Patrick Hand](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Patrick+Hand?query=patrick) was used from google fonts for the childlike primary headers and titles.
	
- [Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins?query=poppins) was used from google fonts for all other secondary text.
	
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used throughout the site, such as the social media icons in the footer.


## User Stories

### New Site Users
	
- As a new site user, I would like to find contact information or social media links easily so that I can simply contact the nursery with any queries and view updates on social media if necessary.
- As a new site user, I would like to see a simple gallery, so that I can get an idea of what the nursery looks like and the rooms/facilities they have.

## Features

### Existing Features

**Brand logo**
	
- When deciding a brand name for my nursery I decided little hatchlings would be very fitting as it symbolises that the children are young and growing together all in one place. I created the logo myself using a fun and childlike handrawn typeface to represent the playful, fun and creative aspect of our nursery.
Logo's are a way of identifying the business and gives the target audience an idea of what the company does. The target audience will recognize the brand and business by it's logo and may even make a judgement based on how the logo makes them feel and this is the value it will give having it on the website. 
Having a logo will also benefit the users as when people are recommending the nursery or try to explain to other parents the location of the nursery by word of mouth, or online when shown the logo the parents may recognize the logo and where they have seen it before when passing by etc. 
	
![screenshot](documentation/logo.png)


**Navigation Bar**

- The navigation bar consists of a simple inline top right corner list of buttons which all have a grey font unless they are on the active page. The active page has a light purple background color with bold purple text. The navbar page links include a hover effect on the pages they are not currently on so when hovering over that button the font changes a black colour instead of grey.
With the mobile version it is the same design but I have a added a box shadow and purple border on the left to make it obvious to the user that it is a dropdown box overlaying the background and again, which page they are currently on.
The benefit to the user is that it has been designed user friendly as the users do not have to be inconvenienced by scrolling back up to the top of the page to change pages and it is clearly highlighted which page they are on. 
The value this brings to the company is a good impression for the nursery as it demonstrates we have thought from the users point of view and the user leaves the website happy due to the smooth use of the website not having to click on many things to get to their destination.

![screenshot](documentation/navbar-feature.png)


**Hero callout image**

 - As previously mentioned in the UX section, I designed the hero image using a photo of my daughter in which I used photoshop and illustrator to help create the design. The heading says 'Watch their confidence grow as big as their imagination' in a child style typeface to create a fun childlike visual effect to compliment the illustration and the logo in the navbar. The heading inspired me to design the hero image, which is an illustration of an astronaut helmet drawn over an image of a child pretending to be flying out in space. I have used a hero image like this to keep the child-like playful design theme that is in the logo flow through the website design. The callout page is the first thing the user will see so it needs to be visually appealing and intrigue the user enough to want to keep scrolling and therefore this is why I have decided on this hero image. Also, some other nursery competitors have a website and so keeps up with the competition.
 Most users trust a business that has a good website as they give a reliable impression and build credibility but also is a great interation tool between the business and the users.
 The hero image also includes a call to action button that takes you to the contact page so if the user came to the website to look for contact information the option is there immediatley which makes it very convenient for the users too. 

![screenshot](documentation/home-page-features.png)


**Carousel of testimonials**
	
- I have used bootstrap to help create a carousel for the parent testimonials/reviews. It can benefit the customer as it scrolls automatically or they can use the buttons to scroll through at their own pace. Also, the user can see the reviews one at a time rather than all at once and being an overload of information, again referring to the hick's law it reduces the complex structure of information. The value the carousel brings to the site is to enable more than one piece of information to occupy the same piece of the website freeing up space for more features without it looking overcrowded. I have kept the carousel design styling very minimal as it will take away from the key feature which are the reviews. Also, I have made the carousel heading to be positioned above the fold of the callout page so that users know to scroll down for more information and the yellow highlight of the header catches the attention of the user. 

![screenshot](documentation/carousel-feature.png)
s

**Video & about us section**

- In the about section I have included a video which gives a tour of the nursery to show people what they can expect from the nursery and what the nursery looks like so they dont have the wait until they book a viewing. For first time parents they also get an idea of how a day to day work at the nusery and get the see the other children there is action. The value this could add is to encourage more people to apply for the nursery as the video can make them feel familiar with the nursery before even visiting.
The video also gives a view of the different facilities and activities that the nursery have but it also is a good way to enhance the users retention rate on the website. 
- The about section includes information on the history of the nursery which will give the users a background of the nursery and as seen in the survey responses this is something that they do pay attention to when choosing a nursery. Again, a plain white background with black text to make sure the user does not get distracted by any background styling and making it hard to read. 
For a convenient user expereience I have also included a 'Find a nursery' call for action button to encourage the users to the contact page site where they can send us a message or check on maps to see which branch is the nearest. This tactic is a subtle way to probe the user to ask any questions they may have at the back of their minds easily as the form is already there infront of them which could potentially bring in more interest for the nursery. 
	
![screenshot](documentation/about-video-feature.png)


**Awards and achievements**
	
- The awards and achievment section are simple 4 images of any recent awards, certifications or rating that they have achieved agaisnt a purple background to section them into their own row. By displaying these on the website it will give the users visiting the site another great example of why they can trust the nursery and the reputation that they have. As children will be eating at the nursery providing the cleanliness or food hygiene awards will provide the reassurance that the parents are looking for and showing them exactly what they want to see. Also,im sure that the nursery will be proud to show the awards and achievements to as many people so the website is the best way to display them. 
	
![screenshot](documentation/achievement-feature.png)

**Our Values section**

- For the our values section I have simply included a paragraph which displays clearly the values of the nursery which the nursery requested to be part of the homepage as another way of displaying to the viewers what their priorities are in the nursery. The styling is again, a simple white background with black text so the reader focuses solely on the information. A call for action button is used again but this time for the gallery as a quick suggestion of what the users may want to see next and another way of subtly keeping the users interacting with the website longer.

![screenshot](documentation/our-values-features.png)

**Footer**
- The footer is simply based at the bottom of the page with a grey background and the options of different social media links and contact information in black icons used from font awesome. The footers benefits are that its giving the options to view the nursery's online precence easily as they can see more real-time feedback from other parents and nursery updates. It is convenient as the links go directly to the social media websites so the users do not have to go looking for the websites independently, it is all in one place and responsive on different screen sizes. With this in mind, it can increase followers on their social media too and allow parents to share images of what their children have created at nursery etc.

![screenshot](documentation/footer-feature.png)

**Gallery & facilities page**
	
- I decided that creating a whole facilities page may not be feasible in the timescale that I have and so I incorperated the facilities in the gallery page by seperating the gallery into two sections. The reason behind this is because parents want to see the enviroment that their child will be in whilst at the nursery and the images of the rooms, outdoor area etc sets an idea of what it is like and may entice them to book a viewing at the nursery.

- You can see below in the screenshot a layout of the gallery in desktop version and in smaller devices. I have made the heading links for the smaller devices so when clicked it will jump scroll to the second section quickly so it is user friendly.
	
![screenshot](documentation/gallery-feature.png)

- I have also used the bootstrap lightbox feature to allow the images to be viewed in large scale as the images are in 2 columns rather than 1. I made the decision to use 2 columns on small devices to make it user friendly so if more images are added in future it is not exhaustive for the user as they can see more selection on their screen rather than scrolling each individual photo. An example of the lightbox feature is below:

### Future Features

**Check-in booking system**
- An idea could be a check in system for the children on the website or a dashboard where you can see updates throughout the day such as nappy changes, food menu, any medications taken etc to encourage customers to come back and interact with the website more. 

**Staff page displaying all the staff members**
- A page that has all the qualified staff members is important to have so the parents can see who will be looking after their children and putting faces to names can help parents build the relationship and trust with the staff. It can also reassure them to see the qualifications and experience that the staff members have.

**About Us Page**
- I would like to add an about page where I can go more in depth on the backrgound/history of the Nursery because I noticed that every response I had from my survey I conducted said they do like to read about the background of the nursery.

**Update/News section**
- Having a section with updates or recent changes on the nursery would be useful however it is not essential as reflecting on my surveyMonkey responses most customers would refer to our social media page for news/updates. 

**Language options**
- Giving the choice of languages to our users, particularly welsh language as the nursery is based in Wales. Ideally next to the contact us on the navigation bar or on the callout page you could have the choice to switch to welsh language.
